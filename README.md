# Where Creativity Meets Code: A Growth-Oriented Web Developer

My journey to web development may not be traditional, but it perfectly encapsulates my passion for creation, collaboration, and continuous learning.

An international business degree ignited my entrepreneurial spirit, while courses in residential design and modeling fueled my artistic side (and yes, even a modeling course!). However, a deep desire to blend creativity with technical skills led me to web design.

This love for web design led me to pursue a Full-Stack Bootcamp in February 2024, equipping myself with the technical skills to bring my design visions to life. My skillset includes:

### Front-End Technologies
- 🌐 HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- 💻 Javascript
- ⚛️ React
- 🅱️ Bootstrap

### Back-End Technologies
- 🐍 Python
- 🗃️ SQL
- 🧪 Flask
- 🔗 RESTful APIs
- 🔑 JWT

### Design Skills
- 🏷️ Branding
- 📈 Marketing
- 📱 Social Media

### Soft Skills
- 💪 Determined
- 🚀 Proactive
- 👑 Natural Leader

Beyond technical expertise, my diverse work experience strengthens my value as a web developer. From customer service roles at UPS and Avnet to co-founding a marketing agency ("The Socialdys"), I've honed my communication, collaboration, and sales skills. This allows me to understand user needs and translate them into impactful web experiences.

My hunger for growth doesn't stop at web development. I'm actively exploring cybersecurity courses and hold certifications as a Google Partner and Community Manager. This continuous learning mindset ensures I stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and marketing strategies.

## What I'm Looking For:
- 🤝 An opportunity to join a collaborative team and contribute my creative and technical skills to building innovative web applications.
- 🌱 A dynamic environment that fosters growth and learning.
- 🌟 A chance to leverage my diverse background to create user-centric and impactful web experiences.
